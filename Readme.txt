# I love git.
# I'm gonna try more with it.
# 2
# I'm gonna handle all this.
# and will make a lot of fun from it.
# 3
# This is used for coding cooperation.
# also some communication.
# 4
# I'm getting used to this.
# This is easy.
# 5
# Wow, lots of functions there.
# Still long way to go.
# 6
# Need to practice it more often.
# Hope this will do me lots of good.
# 7
# Trying git branch.
# Getting much much better.

# Christmas Eve!
# Have fun!

# The git branch is a little bit confusing.
# But I'm OK with it.
# 10
# Looks like the branches were where you commited the contents.
# Not where you edited or staged.
# 11
# Branches are good places to store changes.
# Master is the one awaits and changes later.
# 12
# Now I'm trying the no-ff mode.
# Looks like it could leave records of deleted branches.
# 13
# Haha, lol, the no-ff mode is not that hard.
# It could just leave marks so that you may know the modification was made on another pre-existed branch which was then somehow deleted.
# 14
# Now here comes the last part.
# Fetching the given branch that might been modified by others.
# 15
# After all these trying and experiences.
# It's actually quite simple.
# I could definitely handle all these.
# 16
# Approaching to the end of the course
# Interesting and useful, very nice experience.
